# AI: Assignment 2

## Task

The full task can be read [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14jDA74WCqQtqo7bOKhc7F36Yj8gH7Ha7/view?usp=sharing).

Given several test input images of 512x512 pixels, using any programming language produce via any **evolutionary algorithm** another 512x512 image from a single test one by using your _computational artist_ (algorithm).

The outcome must be a **piece of art** and will be evaluated in the art contest by both students and experts panel (including artists and poets, some computational artists and some analog from about the globe).

#### **Everything below may be changed completely or just partialy during the development process!**

## Plan

- [x] Read about Genetic algorithm basics
- [x] Read about image recognition and processing
- [x] Choose the technology stack
- [x] Create a GitHub Repository
- [ ] Implement Genetic algorithm
- [ ] Include image segmentation and processing
- [ ] Integrate the project with Flask `Likely`
- [ ] Add user interface for interacting with the program `Likely`
- [ ] Deploy the whole project on server `Likely`

## Architecture stack

1. **Python** for the backend
    1. **Pillow** framework for image processing
    2. **Scikit-image** module for image segmentation `Likely`
2. **Flask** for transformation the project into the web-application `Likely`
3. **HTML + CSS + JS** for the frontend
4. **Heroku** as the place for project deployment

## Implementation

_Will be added after the project is done._
